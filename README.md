# Web Development Project 2 - *Geo Trip*

Submitted by: **Artem Guz**

This web app: **This web app is a flashcard application designed to help users learn and test their knowledge interactively. It features a collection of cards, each displaying a question related to geography. When a user clicks on a card, it reveals the answer. Users can navigate through the cards randomly, and a counter displays the current card number and the total number of cards, helping users track their progress. The simple and intuitive interface makes it an effective tool for learning and testing geographical knowledge.**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

## Notes

Creating the flip animation for the flashcards turned out to be more challenging than I anticipated. Despite my efforts, I couldn't get the animation to work exactly as I had envisioned. However, I still managed to implement a nice, simpler animation that added a good level of interactivity to the flashcards. This experience taught me to adapt and find creative solutions when faced with technical limitations.
